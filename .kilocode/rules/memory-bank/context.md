# Context

- **Current focus:** The Memory Bank for the Trellone project has been initialized. This Memory Bank serves as the foundational knowledge base, documenting the project's architecture, technology stack, and product goals. Its purpose is to ensure consistent, high-quality development by providing a central reference for all team members and AI assistants.

- **Recent changes:** The core files of the Memory Bank have been created:

  - `product.md`: Defines the vision, user workflows, and UX goals for Trellone.
  - `architecture.md`: Outlines the SPA architecture, key implementation paths, and design patterns.
  - `tech.md`: Lists the complete technology stack, from React and Vite to `dnd-kit` and `socket.io-client`.
  - `brief.md`: Provides a high-level overview, success metrics, and project scope.

- **Next steps:** The immediate next step is to have the user verify the accuracy and completeness of the newly created Memory Bank files. Once verified, the project is ready for its first development task, with the Memory Bank serving as the primary source of truth.
