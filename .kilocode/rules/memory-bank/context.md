# Current Context

## Work focus

- Initialize a comprehensive Memory Bank for Trellone based on the existing React + TypeScript SPA, documenting tech, architecture, context, and repeatable workflows.
- Verify core application composition, state management, API layer, real-time, routing, and theming to ensure accurate high-level documentation.

## Recent changes

- Created product description in [product.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/product.md)
- Wrote detailed technology overview in [tech.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md)
- Documented system architecture, critical flows, and key paths in [architecture.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md)
- Confirmed application bootstrap providers in [src/main.tsx](src/main.tsx) and route guards in [src/App.tsx](src/App.tsx)
- Verified theme tokens and component overrides in [src/theme.ts](src/theme.ts)
- Confirmed persisted store and middleware composition in [src/lib/redux/store.ts](src/lib/redux/store.ts) and reducer composition in [src/store/root.reducer.ts](src/store/root.reducer.ts)
- Reviewed Axios client and RTK Query base query in [src/lib/http.ts](src/lib/http.ts) and [src/lib/redux/helpers.ts](src/lib/redux/helpers.ts)
- Reviewed Socket.IO client factory and reconnect auth refresh in [src/lib/socket.ts](src/lib/socket.ts)

## Next steps

- Analyze cross-cutting utilities, hooks, and constants for patterns and add notes if any gaps are discovered:
  - Utilities: [src/utils](src/utils)
  - Hooks: [src/hooks](src/hooks)
  - Constants: [src/constants](src/constants)
- Create repeatable workflow documentation (tasks) for common operations (e.g., adding a new RTK Query endpoint) in [tasks.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tasks.md)
- Review all Memory Bank files against the codebase for accuracy, add missing references if needed
- Present a concise summary to the stakeholder for verification and collect any corrections

## Known assumptions and open questions

- Deployment specifics (environments/CI) are not yet captured beyond SPA routing support; add if needed
- Backend API surface is inferred from client code; if a formal API contract is available, link or summarize it here
- Testing strategy is not yet documented; add section if unit/e2e patterns are standardized

## Status summary

- Context: this file
- Tasks: pending (see [tasks.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tasks.md))
