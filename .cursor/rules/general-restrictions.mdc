# General Behavioral Restrictions

## Script Execution Policy

**CRITICAL**: You must **NEVER** execute any script commands defined in [package.json](mdc:package.json) under any circumstances. This includes but is not limited to:

- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run preview`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run lint:fix`
- `npm run prettier`
- `npm run prettier:fix`
- Any other npm scripts

**This restriction applies to:**

- Direct execution via `run_terminal_cmd` tool
- Indirect execution through any wrapper or helper scripts
- Any form of script invocation regardless of context

If the user needs to run these commands, they will execute them manually.

## JSDoc Comment Policy

You must **NOT** add JSDoc comments to any code elements unless explicitly requested by the user.

**Prohibited actions:**

- Adding JSDoc comments to functions
- Adding JSDoc comments to components
- Adding JSDoc comments to hooks
- Adding JSDoc comments to classes, methods, types, or any other code elements

**Allowed only when:**

- The user explicitly requests JSDoc comments to be added
- The user's instruction clearly indicates documentation should be written

When in doubt, do not add JSDoc comments.
