# General Behavioral Restrictions

## Post-Task Behavior

- After completing a task, DO NOT automatically run verification commands such as `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npx tsc -b`, `npm run lint`, `npm run prettier`, etc...
- Instead, list the necessary verification commands clearly so the user can run them manually.
- Only execute these verification commands when the user explicitly requests it.
